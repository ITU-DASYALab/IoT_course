## Exercise 5
## Networking 2 - From Wi-Fi to LoRaWAN

### Goal for the day

Assuming we had reached the point where we can send sensor data via MQTT over Wi-Fi

(if not - let us get there first!)

  * Change our LoPy4 connectivity from Wi-Fi over to LoRaWAN
    * Change code on LoPy
    * Connect devices to LoRaWAN applications on The Things Network
    
The guide for this is here:

  * Adjust our data formating to LoRa conditions

### Accompanying Questions:

- What are acceptable data rates / message sizes for Wi-Fi and for LoRaWAN?
- What do you need to specify when creating a new LoRaWAN application
- What information is needed in order to connect a device to an existing LoRaWAN application?
