## Assignment Proposal
The course is a regular MSc course, graded based on written and oral exam.
There is as such no mandatory project/assignment, and the student’s success does not depend on participation in assignment work.
However, we encourage students to participate actively in a series of exercises that combined will form a project assignment.

Out of the many subdomains of the IoT, we focus on scientific data generation, with strong emphasis of network aspects.
While students will learn all elements that would be essential for short range, high bandwidth IoT (e.g. Smart home, smart building, Industry 4.0), 
the course takes no direct interest in these applications.

Instead, we focus on data collection under somewhat extreme conditions – remote locations, long ranges, constrained systems - 
and in particular, in context with our satellite project (DISCO), we suggest 

__IoT systems for stratospheric balloon missions__

## Exercises - Part 1

### Learning outcomes

Students will learn to

  * program __embedded boards/systems__
  * read and process __sensor__ data
  * communicate sensor data via IoT __networks__

#### Goal

Design sensor nodes for a stratospheric balloon mission

### Suggested work and components

  * ESP32 boards (TTGO T-Beam)
    * important: hardware version differences!
      * V1.1 - SX1276
      * V1.2 - SX126_
     
  * Choice of sensors

### What sensor data might be of interest in stratospheric missions? ###

    • Temperature
    • Light
    • Position, motion, acceleration
    • Power conditions of the balloon system (battery, solar, …)
    • Trace gases
    • Particulate matter, aerosols, exotic metals, e.g. as injected by satellite debris 
    • Cosmic ray detection

Other mesurements of interest:

    * network metrics
