# Exercise week 02
## Hello World! - Simple blink program

### Goal for the day

  * Familiarize yourself with a LilyGo-board
  * Connect to it
  * Write and upload a simple blink program

---

### Useful resources

Below are a few valuable resources to refer to when trying to solve exercises.


__Attention!__  The board exists in two hardware revisions - a V 1.1 and a V1.2.
We *hope* to have a unifom set of devices (V1.2) but please doublecheck!


The differences will mainly become important, once we get to LoRa networking - the two boards have different LoRa chips and require different libraries!

For today we are still fine ignoring the differences (largely).
